# SLR.Finance Overview

SlrFinance is automatic liquidity acquisition yield farm and DeFi 3.0 running on Binance Smart Chain with lots of unique and creative features that let you earn and win. SLrFinance tokenomics is a hybrid between yield farming and Safemoon and DeFi 3.0.

## Main Features

### Automatic Liquidity <a href="#automatic-liquidity" id="automatic-liquidity"></a>

Each transfer of SLR must pay a 10% transfer tax. The 9% transfer tax gets added to the liquidity pool through the contract automatically to raise the price floor continuously. And the liquidity will be locked and inaccessible.

### DeFi 3.0 <a href="#automatic-liquidity" id="automatic-liquidity"></a>

Liquidity can never be dried up because it's owned by the MilkyWay protocol from the Buyback & burn to Liquidity process. MilkyWay uses the accumulated tokens in other profit generation protocols, and uses the received profit to Buyback & burn to Liquidity.
